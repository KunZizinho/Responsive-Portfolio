                                After I got my high school diploma, worked as a bartender in nightclubs of Croatia.
                                2012 I joined Carnival Cruise Lines where i stayed for five and a half years.
                                Traveled all over the world as a bartender in a crafted cocktail bar.
                                <br>
                                After 11 years behind the bar, I decided to change my profession.
                                In 2016, I passed 5 exams and received comTIA stackable certifications.
                                the first 3 exams were not difficult since I had a background in computer hardware.
                                I worked for 3 months as an intern, and after taking my last compTia security + exam I
                                got a job at an MSP company.
                                I spent just under a year working as a help desk technician for UCBOE.

                                Working on various projects as a help desk technician
                                my attention was drawn to development.
                                And since I'm passionate about creativity, I decided to enroll in bootcamp.
